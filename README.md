<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project has been created with the main goal to provide a easy-to-use development platform to solve [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in C++.



Features:

* C++ 20 standard
* `CMake`-based project: feel free to split your logic into several files and classes as you wish.
* Quality tools: `clang-tidy`, sanitizers, compiler warnings, ...
* `vcpkg` already integrated: import and use any C++ library very easily from
  the [vcpkg catalog](https://vcpkg.io/en/packages.html).
* Unit-testing with `Catch2` library: create unit tests to validate the example inputs, or to validate that your future changes don't break your code.
* Multi-platform: designed to be usable in Windows, Linux and MacOs.
* Dockerization: if you don't want to pollute your computer with all the required development tools, there is a Docker
  image available to start developing in a matter of seconds.
